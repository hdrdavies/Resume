# Resume - Huw Davies

I’m an enthusiastic full-stack javascript developer who loves to learn the latest frameworks and technologies (React.js, Hapi.js, D3 etc.), and put them into action in the applications I build. I am experienced in working within agile development environments and have a real passion for simple UX and clean designs. I very much enjoy teaching and sharing any of my knowledge.
